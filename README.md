## Exercises

1. **Guest List:** Given an array of names like `array("Alex", "Nikki", "Sumeet")`, write a function that will return a string with the number of names in the array, as well as each name, like: `"Your event has 3 RSVPs: Alex, Nikki, and Sumeet."`

2. **High Scores:** Given an associative array with people's names as keys and integers as values, write a function that only returns the names/keys that have a value higher than `90`.

3. **Date Calculator:** Given a date in the format `dd-mm-yyyy`, write a function that returns the number of days it has been since that date occurred. You do not need to account for leap years. This problem is slightly more complicated; break it down in stages:
    - First, write your function so that it only takes a string `yyyy` returns the number of years that have passed since the year in the string.
    - Then, alter your function so that is takes a string `mm-yyyy` and returns the number of months that have passed.
    - Then, alter your function so that it still takes a string `mm-yyyy` but returns the number of days that have passed. 
    - Finally, add days to your input string `dd-mm-yyyy` and alter your function to calculate the precise number of days that have passed
